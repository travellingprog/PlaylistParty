        <small>With a user account, anything you add to the playlist can only be removed by you. On top of that, you get more options and PlaylistParty will keep track of the last 20 playlists that you've participated in. If another user adds something to the playlist that you really like, you can click the <strong>Nice!</strong> button to increase the <em>Thumbs Up</em> count of that item.</small>

      </h4>
      <p>
        <small>You can shrink the browser window to fit your needs, without losing any features. <strong>Give it a try!</strong> You can hide the controls, too, for some extra space when you're browsing.</small>
