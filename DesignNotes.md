!! Current Things I Don't Like

Doesn't work on mobile.

Can't see the length of the videos in the Youtube search results.

Soundcloud search is pretty much broken. Even when it worked it wasn't reliable.

The homepage is ugly as hell.

The colors used are pretty bad. No real theme to it.

When you get search results, "Add" and "Select" are pretty confusing, most people don't get how they're different.

No way to reorder songs.

The sharing of playlists is pretty crude.

There's no way to increase the video players, aside from going full screen.

No way to stay full screen throughout the playlist.

Can't search and keep *viewing* videos, only hearing them.

No suggestions.

Liking and Disliking items doesn't really do anything.

No way to view the playlist as just a list.

No way to lock your playlist from others.

Too many things done through wordy pop-ups.

The controls are in a strange position.

The minimization of controls is not obvious.

Going back and forth in the search results is not obvious.

Some items are bigger than others
